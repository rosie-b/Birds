    name: 'Kōkako'
    description: 'The kōkako has a beautiful, clear, organ-like song. Its call can carry for kilometres. Breeding pairs sing together in a bell-like duet for up to an hour in the early morning. Kōkako are poor fliers and seldom fly more than 100 metres. They do not fly so much as glide! Their ecological niche is frequently compared to that of flying squirrels. Low key the best birdie.'

    name: 'Kiwi'
    description: 'Kiwi lay the largest egg in relation to their body size of any species of bird in the world. Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them. Once bonded, a male and female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, in which both parents are involved.'

    name: 'Ruru'
    description: 'Also known as Morepork. Its names are derived from its two-tone call. Four subspecies of Ruru are recognized, one of which has become extinct and another exists only as a hybrid population. During the day, Ruru sleep in roosts. Although mainly nocturnal, they are sometimes active at dawn and dusk. The main hunting times are evenings and mornings, with brief bursts of activity through the night. On dark nights they often perch through the middle hours and, particularly if the weather is bad, may hunt by daylight instead.'

    name: 'Tui'
    description: 'Tui are considered to be very intelligent, much like parrots. They also resemble parrots in their ability to clearly imitate human speech, and were trained by Māori to replicate complex speech. Some of the wide range of tui sounds are beyond the human register. Male tui can be extremely aggressive, chasing all other birds (large and small) from their territory with loud flapping and sounds akin to rude human speech. The powered flight of tui is quite loud as they have developed short wide wings, giving excellent maneuverability in the dense forest they prefer, but requiring rapid flapping. '

    name: 'Weka'
    description:'Weka were used by the Māori as a source of food, perfume, oil to treat inflammations, feathers in clothing and lures to catch dogs. On average, female weka lay three creamy or pinkish eggs blotched with brown and mauve. Both sexes incubate. The Department of Conservation identifies eight main threats to weka. Predation by ferrets, cats, and dogs are a threat to adult weka;[17] stoats and ferrets are a threat to chicks; stoats and rats are a threat to eggs. They have been known to steal shiny objects such as tin-foil.'

    name: 'Hoiho'
    description: 'Also known as Yellow Eyed Penguin'
    status: 'The yellow-eyed penguin may be long lived, with some individuals reaching 20 years of age. This species of penguin is endangered, with an estimated population of 4000. It is considered one of the world\'s rarest penguin species. The main threats include habitat degradation and introduced predators. It may be the most ancient of all living penguins.'},

    name: 'Takahe'
    description: 'The takahē is a sedentary and flightless bird currently found in alpine grasslands habitats. Although it is indigenous to swamps, humans have turned its swampland habitats into farmland, and the takahē was forced to move upland into the grasslands. It is territorial and remains in the grassland until the arrival of snow, when it descends to the forest or scrub. It was thought to be extinct after the last four known specimens were taken in 1898.'

    name: 'Kea'
    description: 'Kea are known for their intelligence and curiosity, both vital to their survival in a harsh mountain environment. Kea can solve logical puzzles, such as pushing and pulling things in a certain order to get to food, and will work together to achieve a certain objective. They have been filmed preparing and using tools.'

    name: 'Kereru'
    description:'Kereru make occasional soft coo sounds (hence the onomatopoeic names), and their wings make a very distinctive "whooshing" sound as they fly. Kereru will often ascend slowly before making impressively steep parabolic dives; it is thought that this behaviour is often associated with nesting, or nest failure. They play an important ecological role, as they are the only birds capable of eating the largest native fruits and drupes (those with smallest diameter greater than 1 cm), such as those of the taraire, and thus spreading the seeds intact.'

    name: 'Kakapo'
    description:'Kākāpō used to be one of the most common birds in New Zealand, found across almost the entire country. Hunting, habitat loss and the introduction of mammalian predators lead to a severe decline in the population. By 1995 there were only 51 kākāpō known to survive. By the 1970s only 18 kākāpō were left – all in Fiordland and all males. The species seemed doomed. But in 1977, a population of male and female kākāpō was discovered on Stewart Island. A combination of traits make it unique among its kind; it is the world\'s only flightless parrot, the heaviest parrot, nocturnal, herbivorous, visibly sexually dimorphic in body size, has a low basal metabolic rate and no male parental care, and is the only parrot to have a polygynous lek breeding system.'

    name: 'Whio'
    description:'This species is an endemic resident breeder in New Zealand, nesting in hollow logs, small caves and other sheltered spots. It is a rare duck, holding territories on fast flowing mountain rivers. It is a powerful swimmer even in strong currents, but is reluctant to fly. It is difficult to find, but not particularly wary when located. The Whio is depicted on the reverse side of the New Zealand $10 banknote.'

    name: 'Kaka'
    description: 'Kea are unashamedly reckless. Whether they are testing your car, your brand new alpine tent or your lunch, they certainly make themselves known. Their cheeky antics and curious behaviour often lands them in a whole lot of trouble, landing them the notorious title of "clown of the mountains". This group of parrots is unusual, retaining more primitive features lost in most other parrots, because it split off from the rest around 100 million years ago. As cavity nesters with a long incubation period that requires the mother to stay on the nest for at least 90 days, kaka are particularly vulnerable to predation.'
